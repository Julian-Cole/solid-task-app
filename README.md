# Solid Task App

This app is based on the great work of Alain Burgeois's and his introduction to Solid with his "Solid Task App",  I just changed the UI a bit.

Note: The app ui doesn't really work visually in a full screen web browser,  so I suggest you install it on your phone and try it out;  to install on your phone, open the demo link below,  then on Android Chome select from the Chrome menu options "Add to Home Screen",  this will allow you to open the app like an app from your phone home screen. Unfortunatly i don't have an Apple phone to test but it might be fairly similar.

The Demo is [Here](https://julian-cole.github.io/solid-task-app/)  (note: swipe-left to bring up the delete option)
