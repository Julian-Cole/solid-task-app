# solid-task-app

This app is based on the work of Alain Burgeois's solid task app code;  I just changed the UI a bit,  and probably introduced a few bugs along the way.

Note: The app ui doesn't really work visually in a full screen web browser,  so I suggest you install on your phone and try it out.
