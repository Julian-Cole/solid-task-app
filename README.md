# solid-task-app

This app is based on the great work of Alain Burgeois's and his introduction to Solid with his "Solid Task App",  I just added more of an "app" looking ui


Note: The app ui doesn't really work visually in a full screen web browser,  so I suggest you install it on your phone and try it out.


The Demo is [Here](https://julian-cole.github.io/solid-task-app/)  (note: swipe-left to bring up the delete option)
